This is a demo project made for Keleya pregnancy app.

# Getting Started

All front end onboarding screens are completed. Just pull the latest code,

Run <br> 
npm install <br> 
npx pod-install

and then start running project on any platform you desire.

## Flow and Structure

Based on the given screens and assets, I have designed the layout using react native native reuseable components. I have also used the typescript where needed. There were some minor missing assets like bell icon, check box icon, show/hide password icon. I have used them from my side. I have tried my best to match the layout and flow with sample screens. I have used packages like react navigation, react redux, redux persist, date picker components. Although there was not much use of redux for demo but I added it to show that I completely understand the flow and redux state management. I have also used i18next package for multi-language support. Both English and German languages are supported. I have also used a helper class(Responsive Screen) to make static pixel numbers adjustable according to screen size. And I have also developed a native iOS module in the last Success.js screen to show my understanding about developing native modules.
